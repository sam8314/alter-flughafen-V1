* BUG == animal not displaying when moving (animation good, frame_index updates but does not display on screen :: in level.py fix run(self) ?)
* make a sprites group for animals
* add animal to species dictionnary when the collision with player is good
* make generale rule of the frog:
    * in settings.py do a ANIMALS list like the SPECIES
* change frog animation
